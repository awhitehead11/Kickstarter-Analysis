# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to understand two things: What monetary size of campaigns have the best results, and what launch dates have the best results.
## Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis by taking raw data on campaigns, and grouping them by various criteria.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges came from having to go back and adjust data to allow for the groupings we wanted.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. May, June, and July are the best months to launch (see "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch" attachment)
    2. December is the worst month to launch.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    1. Smaller goals tend to be more successful (see "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch" attachment)
    2. If you do need to aim larger, then 35,000-44,999 is the right rage.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - It does not give us a full picture of any other variables outside of the campaigns that might have impacted.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - understanding how different categories and subcategories performed would most likely tell us drastically different things.
